# Guestbook

Guestbook is an example application showing basic usage of Google App
Engine. Users can read & write text messages and optionally log-in with
their Google account. Messages are stored in App Engine (NoSQL)
High Replication Datastore (HRD) and retrieved using a strongly consistent
(ancestor) query.

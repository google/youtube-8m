# YouTube-8M Tensorflow Starter Code

This repo contains starter code for training and evaluating machine learning
models over the [YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) dataset.
The code gives an end-to-end working example for reading the dataset, training a
TensorFlow model, and evaluating the performance of the model. Out of the box,
you can train several [model architectures](#overview-of-models) over either
frame-level or video-level features. The code can easily be extended to train
your own custom-defined models.

It is possible to train and evaluate on YouTube-8M in two ways: on Google Cloud
or on your own machine. This README provides instructions for both.

## Running on Google's Cloud Machine Learning Platform

### Requirements

This option requires you to have an appropriately configured Google Cloud
Platform account. To create and configure your account, please make sure you
follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/ml/docs/how-tos/getting-set-up).
If you are participating in the Google Cloud & YouTube-8M Video Understanding
Challenge hosted on kaggle.com, see [these instructions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m#getting-started-with-google-cloud) instead.

Please also verify that you have Tensorflow 1.0.0 or higher installed by
running the following command:

```sh
python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'
```

### Testing Locally
All gcloud commands should be done from the directory *immediately above* the
source code. You should be able to see the source code directory if you
run 'ls'.

As you are developing your own models, you will want to test them
quickly to flush out simple problems without having to submit them to the cloud.
You can use the `gcloud beta ml local` set of commands for that.

Here is an example command line for video-level training:

```sh
gcloud beta ml local train \
--package-path=youtube-8m --module-name=youtube-8m.train -- \
--train_data_pattern='gs://youtube8m-ml/1/video_level/train/train*.tfrecord' \
--train_dir=/tmp/yt8m_train --start_new_model
```

You might want to download some training shards locally to speed things up and
allow you to work offline. The command below will copy 10 out of the 4096
training data files to the current directory.

```sh
# Downloads 55MB of data.
gsutil cp gs://us.data.yt8m.org/1/video_level/train/traina[0-9].tfrecord .
```
Once you download the files, you can point the job to them using the
'train_data_pattern' argument (i.e. instead of pointing to the "gs://..."
files, you point to the local files).

Once your model is working locally, you can scale up on the Cloud
which is described below.

### Training on the Cloud over Video-Level Features

The following commands will train a model on Google Cloud
over video-level features.

```sh
BUCKET_NAME=gs://${USER}_yt8m_train_bucket
# (One Time) Create a storage bucket to store training logs and checkpoints.
gsutil mb -l us-central1 $BUCKET_NAME
# Submit the training job.
JOB_NAME=yt8m_train_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S); gcloud --verbosity=debug beta ml jobs \
submit training $JOB_NAME \
--package-path=youtube-8m --module-name=youtube-8m.train \
--staging-bucket=$BUCKET_NAME --region=us-central1 \
--config=youtube-8m/cloudml-gpu.yaml \
-- --train_data_pattern='gs://youtube8m-ml/1/video_level/train/train*.tfrecord' \
--train_dir=$BUCKET_NAME/yt8m_train_video_level_logistic_model
```

In the 'gsutil' command above, the 'package-path' flag refers to the directory
containing the 'train.py' script and more generally the python package which
should be deployed to the cloud worker. The module-name refers to the specific
python script which should be executed (in this case the train module). Since
the training data files are hosted in the public 'youtube8m-ml' storage bucket
in the 'us-central1' region, we've colocated our job in the same
region in order to have the fastest access to the data.

It may take several minutes before the job starts running on Google Cloud.
When it starts you will see outputs like the following:

```
training step 270| Hit@1: 0.68 PERR: 0.52 Loss: 638.453
training step 271| Hit@1: 0.66 PERR: 0.49 Loss: 635.537
training step 272| Hit@1: 0.70 PERR: 0.52 Loss: 637.564
```

At this point you can disconnect your console by pressing "ctrl-c". The
model will continue to train indefinitely in the Cloud. Later, you can check
on its progress or halt the job by visiting the
[Google Cloud ML Jobs console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ml/jobs).

You can train many jobs at once and use tensorboard to compare their performance
visually.

```sh
tensorboard --logdir=$BUCKET_NAME --port=8080
```

Once tensorboard is running, you can access it at the following url:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
If you are using Google Cloud Shell, you can instead click the Web Preview button
on the upper left corner of the Cloud Shell window and select "Preview on port 8080".
This will bring up a new browser tab with the Tensorboard view.

### Evaluation and Inference
Here's how to evaluate a model on the validation dataset:

```sh
JOB_TO_EVAL=yt8m_train_video_level_logistic_model
JOB_NAME=yt8m_eval_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S); gcloud --verbosity=debug beta ml jobs \
submit training $JOB_NAME \
--package-path=youtube-8m --module-name=youtube-8m.eval \
--staging-bucket=$BUCKET_NAME --region=us-central1 \
--config=youtube-8m/cloudml-gpu.yaml \
-- --eval_data_pattern='gs://youtube8m-ml/1/video_level/validate/validate*.tfrecord' \
--train_dir=$BUCKET_NAME/${JOB_TO_EVAL} --run_once=True
```

And here's how to perform inference with a model on the test set:

```sh
JOB_TO_EVAL=yt8m_train_video_level_logistic_model
JOB_NAME=yt8m_inference_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S); gcloud --verbosity=debug beta ml jobs \
submit training $JOB_NAME \
--package-path=youtube-8m --module-name=youtube-8m.inference \
--staging-bucket=$BUCKET_NAME --region=us-central1 \
--config=youtube-8m/cloudml-gpu.yaml \
-- --input_data_pattern='gs://youtube8m-ml/1/video_level/test/test*.tfrecord' \
--train_dir=$BUCKET_NAME/${JOB_TO_EVAL} \
--output_file=$BUCKET_NAME/${JOB_TO_EVAL}/predictions.csv
```

Note the confusing use of 'training' in the above gcloud commands. Despite the
name, the 'training' argument really just offers a cloud hosted
python/tensorflow service. From the point of view of the Cloud Platform, there
is no distinction between our training and inference jobs. The Cloud ML platform
also offers specialized functionality for prediction with
Tensorflow models, but discussing that is beyond the scope of this readme.

Once these job starts executing you will see outputs similar to the
following for the evaluation code:

```
examples_processed: 1024 | global_step 447044 | Batch Hit@1: 0.782 | Batch PERR: 0.637 | Batch Loss: 7.821 | Examples_per_sec: 834.658
```

and the following for the inference code:

```
num examples processed: 8192 elapsed seconds: 14.85
```


### Accessing Files on Google Cloud

You can browse the storage buckets you created on Google Cloud, for example, to
access the trained models, prediction CSV files, etc. by visiting the
[Google Cloud storage browser](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser).

Alternatively, you can use the 'gsutil' command to download the files directly.
For example, to download the output of the inference code from the previous
section to your local machine, run:


```
gsutil cp $BUCKET_NAME/${JOB_TO_EVAL}/predictions.csv .
```

### Using Frame-Level Features

Append
```sh
--frame_features=True --model=FrameLevelLogisticModel --feature_names="rgb" \
--feature_sizes="1024" --batch_size=256
--train_dir=$BUCKET_NAME/yt8m_train_frame_level_logistic_model
```

to the 'gcloud' commands given above, and change 'video_level' in paths to
'frame_level'.

The 'FrameLevelLogisticModel' is designed to provide equivalent results to a
logistic model trained over the video-level features. Please look at the
'models.py' file to see how to implement your own models.


### Using Audio Features

The feature files (both Frame-Level and Video-Level) contain two sets of
features: 1) visual and 2) audio. The code defaults to using the visual
features only, but it is possible to use audio features instead of (or besides)
visual features. To specify the (combination of) features to use you must set
`--feature_names` and `--feature_sizes` flags. The visual and audio features are
called 'rgb' and 'audio' and have 1024 and 128 dimensions, respectively.
The two flags take a comma-separated list of values in string. For example, to
use audio-visual Video-Level features the flags must be set as follows:

```
--feature_names="mean_rgb, mean_audio" --feature_sizes="1024, 128"
```

Similarly, to use audio-visual Frame-Level features use:

```
--feature_names="rgb, audio" --feature_sizes="1024, 128"
```

**NOTE:** Make sure the set of features and the order in which the appear in the
lists provided to the two flags above match. Also, the order must match when
running training, evaluation, or inference.


## Running on Your Own Machine

### Requirements

The starter code requires Tensorflow. If you haven't installed it yet, follow
the instructions on [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
This code has been tested with Tensorflow 1.0.0. Going forward, we will continue
to target the latest released version of Tensorflow.

You can find complete instructions for downloading the dataset on the
[YouTube-8M website](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/download.html).
We recommend downloading the smaller video-level features dataset first when
getting started. To do that, run:

```
mkdir -p features; cd features
curl data.yt8m.org/download.py | partition=1/video_level/train mirror=us python
```

This will download the full set of video level features, which takes up 31GB
of space.
If you are located outside of North America, you should change the flag 'mirror'
to 'eu' for Europe or 'asia' for Asia to speed up the transfer of the files.

Change 'train' to 'validate'/'test' and re-run the command to download the
other splits of the dataset.

Change 'video_level' to 'frame_level' to download the frame-level features. The
complete frame-level features take about 1.71TB of space. You can set the
environment variable 'shard' to 'm,n' to download only m/n-th of the data. For
example, to download 1/100-th of the frame-level features from the training set,
run:

```
curl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=1/frame_level/train mirror=us python
```

### Training on Video-Level Features

To start training a logistic model on the video-level features, run

```sh
MODEL_DIR=/tmp/yt8m
python train.py --train_data_pattern='/path/to/features/train*.tfrecord' --train_dir=$MODEL_DIR/video_level_logistic_model
```

Since the dataset is sharded into 4096 individual files, we use a wildcard (\*)
to represent all of those files.

By default, the training code will frequently write _checkpoint_ files (i.e.
values of all trainable parameters, at the current training iteration). These
will be written to the `--train_dir`. If you re-use a `--train_dir`, the trainer
will first restore the latest checkpoint written in that directory. This only
works if the architecture of the checkpoint matches the graph created by the
training code. If you are in active development/debugging phase, consider
adding `--start_new_model` flag to your run configuration.

### Evaluation and Inference

To evaluate the model, run

```sh
python eval.py --eval_data_pattern='/path/to/features/validate*.tfrecord' --train_dir=$MODEL_DIR/video_level_logistic_model --run_once=True
```

As the model is training or evaluating, you can view the results on tensorboard
by running

```sh
tensorboard --logdir=$MODEL_DIR
```

and navigating to http://localhost:6006 in your web browser.

When you are happy with your model, you can generate a csv file of predictions
from it by running

```sh
python inference.py --output_file=$MODEL_DIR/video_level_logistic_model/predictions.csv --input_data_pattern='/path/to/features/validate*.tfrecord' --train_dir=$MODEL_DIR/video_level_logistic_model
```

This will output the top 20 predicted labels from the model for every example
to 'predictions.csv'.

### Using Frame-Level Features

Follow the same instructions as above, appending
`--frame_features=True --model=FrameLevelLogisticModel --feature_names="rgb"
--feature_sizes="1024" --train_dir=$MODEL_DIR/frame_level_logistic_model`
for the 'train.py', 'eval.py', and 'inference.py' scripts.

The 'FrameLevelLogisticModel' is designed to provide equivalent results to a
logistic model trained over the video-level features. Please look at the
'models.py' file to see how to implement your own models.

### Using Audio Features

See [Using Audio Features](#using-audio-features) section above.

### Ground-Truth Label Files

We also provide CSV files containing the ground-truth label information of the
'train' and 'validation' partitions of the dataset. These files can be
downloaded using 'gsutil' command:

```
gsutil cp gs://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/train_labels.csv /destination/folder/
gsutil cp gs://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/validate_labels.csv /destination/folder/
```

or directly using the following links:

*   [http://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/train_labels.csv](http://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/train_labels.csv)
*   [http://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/validate_labels.csv](http://us.data.yt8m.org/1/ground_truth_labels/validate_labels.csv)

Each line in the files starts with the video id and is followed by the list of
ground-truth labels corresponding to that video. For example, for a video with
id 'VIDEO_ID' and two lables 'LABLE1' and 'LABEL2' we store the following line:

```
VIDEO_ID,LABEL1 LABEL2
```

## Overview of Models

This sample code contains implementations of three of the models given in the
[YouTube-8M technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08675).

### Video-Level Models
*   `LogisticModel`: Linear projection of the output features into the label
                     space, followed by a sigmoid function to convert logit
                     values to probabilities.
*   `MoeModel`: A per-class softmax distribution over a configurable number of
                logistic classifiers. One of the classifiers in the mixture
                is not trained, and always predicts 0.

### Frame-Level Models
* `DBoFModel`: Projects the features for each frame into a higher dimensional
               'clustering' space, pools across frames in that space, and then
               uses a video-level model to classify the now aggregated features.
* `FrameLevelLogisticModel`: Equivalent to 'LogisticModel', but performs
                             average-pooling on the fly over frame-level
                             features rather than using pre-aggregated features.
